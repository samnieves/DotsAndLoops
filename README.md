# To-Do:

(1) Create function def EnergyEigenfunction(m, ang): that takes the quantum number m and an array of angles ang and returns the RR energy eigenfunctions evaluated at each value of ang

(2) Verify the function by plotting real part of the energy eigenfunctions with quantum number 0, 1, -1, 2, -2.  Plot also the probability density for each energy eigenfunction

(3) Create function def EnergyEigenvalue(m): that takes the quantum number m and returns the energy eigenvalue

(3) Create a function TimeComponent(m, t): taht takes the quantum number m and time value t and returns the time-component of the energy eigenfunction m

(4) Create an animation of the real part of energy eigenfunctions with quantum number 0, 1, -1, 2, -2

(5) Animate the real part of an equal admixture of energy eigenfunction 0 and 1.  Animate the probability density of an equal admixture of energy eigenfunction 0 and 1

(6) Create a function AngleEigenfunction(theta0, ang): that approximates a quantum state with well-defined angule of orientation
